When the Nuclear Replacement is complete, mark successes with an engineered Surface protein that signals this cell has new nuclear material!
This lets us intensely target old cells for replacement, skipping already treated cells.
We use a vector (virus, vacuole, nanomachine etc.) with a special surface protein that binds to cells, skipping already completed cells.
